# CVML

This is a standardized markup language (YAML with pre-defined keys) to write your CV.

I am sick of uploading CV (resume) to every recruitment software, while they use AI/ML but never parse my CV correctly.
I used to format my CV pretty neatly. The grid design even helps a human reader to see the story and highlights behind my career history.
But I broken down my CV to just bullet points, in order for the ATS (Applicat Tracking System) to parse me...
Yet that ATS AI/ML still got it wrong, everytime. Even a pair of simple brackets may confuse it (sometimes). 
Each AI/ML ATS just behave differently. I can never get it right.

Why does it have to be so complicated? Why not all recruiter software just agree to a simple (yet extensible) CV markup language?
So now I propose a base for every recruiter to agree upon, and extends. With my personal CV as an example to start.
